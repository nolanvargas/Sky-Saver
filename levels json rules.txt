levels json rules:
shapeID: required
x: required
y: required
activated: not required of shape is static, determines if shape will free fall on spawn
activationY: optional, when an unactivated shape will activate
activationX: optional, when the uncativated shape will activate (if there is not already x velocity then this will not apply)
dx: required if activated is true or has activationY
dy: required if activated is true or has activationY
static: optional, default is false meaning it will be a moveable object
density: optional, default is regular, light, regular, heavy
friction: optional, default is regular, less, regular, more
bounce: optional, default is none, none, some, more
fixedRotation: optional, default is false
gravity: optional, default is true, determines if gravity applies to shape
omega: optional, default is 0, the rotational velocity (bigger shapes need more rotational force) (The shorthand notation for angular velocity is the Greek letter omega (Ï‰))
activationOmega: optional, the angular velocity at activation
